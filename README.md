# Disease, Epidemics and Vaccination Effectiveness through Agent Based Modelling

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook containing the model for my final project in
ENGG*3130-Modelling Complex Systems. More information about the project can be found on my 
[personal website](https://szentimh.github.io/portfolio/disease-model/).

## Repository Structure

- engg3130-final-project.ipynb: This file is the Jupyter Notebook with the code for the model as well
  as details on the adjustable parameters. The notebook walks through the different implementation
  details of the model and explains some of the decisions made.
  
- environment.yml: Contains the list of packages used for running the notebook.

- utils: Contains code borrowed from one of the labs in the course to be used as part of the project.
  The code for the labs in the course were from Think Complexity 2nd Edition by Allen Downey. The
  GitHub repository for this book can be found [here](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkComplexity2).
